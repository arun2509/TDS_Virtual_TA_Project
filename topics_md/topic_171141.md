[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.  
But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.  
Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine?

Can you tell me what application is this (FastAPI) one ?

**Bharat Choudhary** (_2025-04-07T18:31:51.760Z_)

idk why i am doing this but this is my last request (for evaluation) with proofs. me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.

Dear Sirs,  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.

[Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805×197 9.52 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/b/7b8a704d618edd74036a95649a83054e29932879.png "Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513")

**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent)  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:  
[https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/blob/main/app/app.py).  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: <https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent>.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

24ds3000090

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.

[image1298×857 29.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a49f182e22015df35039be85cdd26ad71a07f7a3.png "image")

I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  


[image1027×510 11 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f99c9908823f381a7756ba6fe89d4827ca2faf4.png "image")

  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya

Hi Haricharan

Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.  
This is the error when building it:

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards

Your container failed to run after building it.
    
    
    docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown
    

Thats why we cannot evaluate it.

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-04-08T06:29:24.100Z_)

There is **clearly** _some difference_ between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

Hi,

Please let me know the reason on why I have not got any bonus marks.

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-04-08T09:37:52.730Z_)

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

**D HARICHARAN ** (_2025-04-08T13:24:46.118Z_)

Respected Sir,

  * Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
  * when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
  * for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
  * after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
  * As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
  * after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
  * just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable



and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:
    
    
    git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git
    

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment
    
    
    docker build -t llm-agent .
    
    
    
    docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
    or
    docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
    

and in another terminal
    
    
    uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000
    

Thank you  
Kind regards

**S Sharmile** (_2025-04-08T15:08:33.577Z_)

Respected sir  
I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.  
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http_proxy and https_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

**Subject:** Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS** , it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is _linux/amd64_ (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

I have passed the pre requisites, but there is no log file for my email.

At least docker logs should be there, right?

Was it missed by any chance?

I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.  
Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test.

**K Senthur Kumaran ** (_2025-04-07T14:51:53.998Z_)

Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:
    
    
    python run.py
    

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

Question: Now that I know. how can I test the container myself, if I want to do exactly what you guys are doing?

---

**Mishkat Chougule** (_2025-04-07T16:23:03.736Z_)

My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via `subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or `npx`, this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

bash:` apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

**Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (_2025-04-06T22:29:11.094Z_)

Anything after deadline we can’t consider any changes, it was just a matter of time, you didn’t tests running evaluate.py on docker container that was created, otherwise you would have spotted this mistake and rectified it.

---

**Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (_2025-04-06T22:34:25.989Z_)

In your github repo, Dockerfile should be named as Dockerfile(D caps).

---

**Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (_2025-04-06T22:39:30.596Z_)

I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.

We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.

**Afsal** (_2025-04-07T04:25:33.067Z_)

Dear Sir,  
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi [@23f1001524](/u/23f1001524) [@afsalshah](/u/afsalshah) [@23f1000879](/u/23f1000879) [@23f1002056](/u/23f1002056)

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand),

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

got consistent 6/25 after even running the file 6 times [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Please sir check this, just because my docker image needs .env, I cannot get full 0…I need to maintain my cgpa (by getting 0 in project my grade is going too close to E grade sir and already in D, already my ROE got bad due to technical issues which on the same day around 6pm after finding way to unlock the input of answers for roe I completed the roe again in short amount of time like 10 or 20 minutes and got 10/10 but still it was rejected because it was late, max 3 minutes after 1:45PM was allowed…I’m not asking to any extra marks, just my marks) I’m trying to improve it already I have 4 subjects in a single term, please give me atleast this marks with the bonus 1 mark for prerequisites (total 7)

Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.
