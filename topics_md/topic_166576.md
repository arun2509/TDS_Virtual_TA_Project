[@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) \- thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

It was solved but again I’m facing the same issue

**Hisham Kadambot** (_2025-02-10T18:54:19.804Z_)

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I’m still facing the issue.

**Nilay Chugh** (_2025-02-11T16:21:34.546Z_)

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.

---

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-02-12T12:52:01.867Z_)

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.

Kind regards

## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

Kindly check the question and the answer. I found below cities for São Paulo.

However, it says my answer is incorrect.

> How many units of Bacon were sold in São Paulo on transactions with at least 151 units?

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

**Aniruddha Mukherjee** (_2025-02-14T16:19:36.462Z_)

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-

Thank you

**Aniruddha Mukherjee** (_2025-02-14T17:47:55.912Z_)

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj), [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Thank you
