[@22f3001315](/u/22f3001315) [@21f3002277](/u/21f3002277) [@24ds2000024](/u/24ds2000024) – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this:
    
    
    Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4
    

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?

edit: This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

**Anand S** (_2025-02-02T05:45:48.804Z_)

[@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237) A good point. Yes, please include _all_ titles. I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.

**Sakthivel S** (_2025-02-03T10:06:13.753Z_)

I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?  
(Assuming they have interacted in this thread)

---

**Anand S** (_2025-02-03T11:16:46.279Z_)

Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a _relevant_ message on this thread will get 11/10

---

**K Hari Prasath** (_2025-02-03T11:38:10.970Z_)

For me I just made filter of rating between 2 and 7 in site and typed in console as per video. with that data got in console worked fine.  
copy the coding and save in place use it for data extract when finally submit

**Joel Jeffrey** (_2025-02-04T05:47:12.930Z_)

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

---

**Anand S** (_2025-02-04T06:15:20.501Z_)

[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.
