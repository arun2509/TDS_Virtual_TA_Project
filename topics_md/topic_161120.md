Hi [@24ds1000082_Vivek](/u/24ds1000082_vivek) ,

I don’t see any difference between them. Can you share screen shot of browser console tab and Network tab. Also join tomorrow’s session towards ending of each session we use to take doubts.

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.

If this doesn’t solve problem, pls join tomorrow’s session between 8-10 towards ending of session we use to take doubts.

Kind regards

> I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work

Hi [@daksh76](/u/daksh76), Can you mention exact error or problem that you are facing.

**Jivraj Singh Shekhawat** (_2025-01-30T22:10:20.492Z_)

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , Thankyou for the quick response. I have attached both console and network screenshots. Hope these are the ones you were referring to. Sure, I will join tonight’s session and try to rectify the issue. Meanwhile will update here if i was able to resolve it.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) pls help me to fix this

**VivekS** (_2025-01-31T06:59:40.374Z_)

you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required, regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you can avoid rework.

**Daksh Agarwal** (_2025-01-31T07:12:15.016Z_)

sir the output im getting after correcting the code is showing incorrect on the portal

---

**Daksh Agarwal** (_2025-01-31T07:14:12.076Z_)

if you could suggest me why is that happening, where am i making an error because i have cross checked this a lot of times and still am unable to understand where i might be making a mistake

---

**K Hari Prasath** (_2025-01-31T10:33:42.441Z_)

I had faced the same issue. Please ensure the url is not protected against the access of third party (IITM will access your url. To check it, try to open the url in different browser)

**Srividhya** (_2025-01-31T14:18:49.279Z_)

Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if **name** == ‘**main** ’:

24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.

I was facing problem that how to make a class as variable name for Q9 in GA2 . but now i get a solution which was helpful for making class as variable. The below command is the solution for the problem of how to make a class variable name in python.

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.  
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You _do not_ create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.

if you have time, could once check my code for question 9. can send github link in chat…

or run this `docker pull 23f3004114/tds_2025_jan_ga2:Q9`

Hi [@23f2004644](/u/23f2004644) and [@bhashwar_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta) ,

You would need to keep all the servers active whenever you click on save button.
