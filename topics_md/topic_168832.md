Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start time?

---

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-03-01T09:01:56.407Z_)

[@bhashwar_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta) No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm.

**Bhashwar Sengupta** (_2025-03-01T09:40:09.245Z_)

Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?

**Yogesh** (_2025-03-01T11:19:35.700Z_)

Is it 45 minutes long?

---

**Vinil** (_2025-03-01T15:16:32.904Z_)

No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’

**Akshit Mittal** (_2025-03-01T16:34:53.754Z_)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA?

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?

---

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-03-02T02:43:00.880Z_)

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam?

I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this?

I submitted my request at the following link:
