My Graded assignment results are also not appearing in the dashboard. My email id is 22f2001532@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

[@24ds3000061](/u/24ds3000061) [@22f2001532](/u/22f2001532)

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard.

Thanks
