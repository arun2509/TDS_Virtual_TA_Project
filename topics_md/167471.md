<p>Good Morning Sir,<br>
Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Thank you<br>

<p>So the reason for the failure is:</p>
<p>You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)</p>
<p>Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.</p>
<p>Then once you realised your mistake, on <strong>Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST</strong> i.e <em>yesteday</em>, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.</p>
<p>Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]<br>

<p>showing that your files are in the correct place.</p>
<p>We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir<br>
Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.</p>
<p>I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/frowning.png?v=12" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.</p>
<p>Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.</p>
<p>Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,<br>
