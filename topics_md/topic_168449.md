### Update 3

#### 26/02/2025 8:11 pm

Dear Learner

Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:

[exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

### [Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.
    
    
    inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
    textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
    buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
    inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).  
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.

We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

Should we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ?

From where can I get today’s live sessions link

---

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-02-25T14:09:41.427Z_)

either is fine. Both have the same data but slightly different presentations

form link not working

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-02-25T14:18:50.402Z_)

Yes we close it at 7:45pm

We will reopen after live session tonight.  
Its a timed mock.

**Telvin Varghese** (_2025-02-25T14:19:32.437Z_)

atleast close 5 mins early I would have copied the questions

**Shubham Atkal** (_2025-02-25T14:31:01.026Z_)

live session gmeet link is not available?

---

**Sagandeep Kaur** (_2025-02-25T14:44:59.458Z_)

After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.

**Shubham Atkal** (_2025-02-25T16:41:32.061Z_)

where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ?  
thanks

**Sagandeep Kaur** (_2025-02-25T17:02:29.814Z_)

When will it reopen?

**Shashannk** (_2025-02-26T03:30:22.514Z_)

dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?

---

**Carlton D'Silva** (_2025-02-26T03:58:19.216Z_)

[@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413)

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

  1. The chaos of ROE.
  2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
  3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
  4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
  5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
  6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
  7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
  8. How limited the time is.



The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab
    
    
    df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]
    

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing) [](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

### [df_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as
    
    
    margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100
    

using this i got answer for 1st question as
    
    
    YEAR                              1992
    AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
    WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
    WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
    WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
    RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
    RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
    RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
    MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114
    

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software

shubhamatkal:

That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.  
Kind regards.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?
